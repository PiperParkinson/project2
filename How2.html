    <h2>How to Use Our Product: Video Tutorials Included</h2>



     There are different ways to use our product based on the outcome you are looking for.  For instance, 
     rubbing and massaging the lotion into your skin will prevent and get rid of existing wrinkles,
     but dabbing the cream will reduce and prevent dark spots and discolouration caused by aging.

     It is suggested to alternate bewteen methods every month.
